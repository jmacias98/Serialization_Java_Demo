This program uses a procedural approach to create a basic demonstration of serialization and deserialization in the Java programming language. 

From a menu you are  able to make a choice from five selections:
1) Add Info to File
2) Retrieve Info from File and Display it
3) Delete Info
4) Update Info
5) Exit

After each entry, the program will ask if you want to create another profile.
A sample deserialized file is included.
